# Contribution Guidelines

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this document and sharing your thoughts with us.

We want to make clear that this document is not a usual contribution document, but just some quick checks to guide you providing feedback about the extension.

## Providing feedback

We manage the community feedback through GitHub discussions. Whe think that's a good way to engage with you, the users, and have single point for public threads.
If you think you found a bug or have a feature request go to the [discussions page](https://github.com/rancherlabs/application-collection-extension/discussions) and then:

* Search in case someone already reported it
* In case no one did it yet then keep reading below ðŸ‘‡

You have something new for us? Thats great! Now, before rushing and writing it on the forum, there is a basic checklist you should review. This will help you describing the problem/feature and us understanding how to fix/implement it. Moreover, this will also help the rest of the community to follow any other discussion. Thus, if you open up a new thread, check these out:

* **Title**: a brief line with the key terms of the feature/bugfix.
* **Description**: detailed description about the feature/bugfix. Make sure it as extensive and full of details as possible. This will help you making yourself clear and reachable from the discussions browser.
* (Bugfixes) **Extension version**: for extension failures this will be key to identify whether if there's already a fix for it or not.
* (Bugfixes) **Platform**: either if it occurs in Rancher Desktop or Docker Desktop. Keep in mind that we offer (or try to) 1:1 compatibility with these platforms, so it is important for us to know where is it failing. Support for any other tool is not guaranteed.
* (Bugfixes) **Steps to reproduce**: this is another **must** for bugs. We will need clear steps to reproduce and identify potential failures.
* (Bugfixes) **Screenshots**: if the failure is visual, at the very least include screenshots. Recordings or any other supporting file will be accepted as well.
* (Bugfixes) **Logs**: these will come handy too, but please **don't paste them in clear text**, as they will add a lot of noise. Instead, upload `.txt` file or a link to download the logs. If you don't know how to get extension logs, read the `README.md`'s sections [Debug with Docker Desktop](/README.md#debug-with-docker-desktop) / [Debug with Rancher Desktop](/README.md#debug-with-rancher-desktop).

## Compatiblity

This extension is developed to work with Rancher Desktop and Docker Desktop, we do not guarantee that it will run as expected in any other tool or platform.

Having this in mind, please take into account that any feature proposal will only be discussed if it is feasible over both platforms.
